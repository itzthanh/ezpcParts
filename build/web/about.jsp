					Christopher is an aspiring full-stack web developer who helped jump-start EZPC Parts.
					With his love and passion for PC and building PCs. Christopher came up with the concept of creating a
					website that sells PC parts. After successfully building his first PC, he found that it was too time
					consuming looking for PC components that he needed, as there are various websites that offer only
					specific kinds of PC parts. Furthermore, it was difficult to track which parts he bought from where and
					had difficulty purchasing the parts he needed due to the steps needed
					purchase the product. Thus, EZPC Parts was born in hopes of making it easy to browse and buy
					products with ease.
